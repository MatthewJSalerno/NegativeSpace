Project: NegativeSpace (Phase 1: Core Engine)
Description: A backend engine for organizing large photo collections based on spec.

Runtime Arguments:
Source and destination must be separate, non-overlapping underlying folders.
Never mount the same folder at both paths or nest one inside the other,
including on network shares. Overlapping mounts can cause unintended file
deletion and are not reliably detected by the engine.

- --source <path> (Optional) Path to unorganized source directory (default: "/data/source").
- --dest <path> (Optional) Path for organized output directory (default: "/data/dest").
- --base <path> (Optional) Base directory for app artifacts (default: "/data").
  Creates/uses <base>/db/ for SQLite and <base>/logs/ for logs.
- --workers <N> (Optional) Override the worker process count used for
  hashing/date resolution (default: os.cpu_count()).
- --exts <.ext1,.ext2,...> (Optional) Comma-separated extension list,
  replacing the built-in default set for directory scanning. Has no effect
  on --file-ids targeting, since that bypasses directory scanning entirely.
- --file-ids <id1,id2,...> (Optional) Comma-separated database row IDs to
  target, bypassing the directory scan and processing exactly these
  already-cataloged files. A file must have gone through at least one prior
  Index for its ID to exist. This is what powers selection-scoped
  operations from the web UI (Phase 2) — e.g. "Move just these 3 photos" —
  but works identically from the CLI. Mutually exclusive with
  --source-subdir.
- --source-subdir <path> (Optional) Path, relative to --source, scoping the
  run to already-cataloged files beneath it. Queries the catalog by
  source_path prefix instead of walking the filesystem or enumerating IDs,
  which is what lets the web UI offer "operate on this whole folder" for
  selections far larger than --file-ids can express (there is a real OS
  limit on command-line length). Mutually exclusive with --file-ids.

Per-file failures never abort a run: an unreadable, vanished, or otherwise
unprocessable file is recorded as status='Failed' with a human-readable
reason in operations.error_message, and the scan carries on with the rest.

Mode flags (mutually exclusive — pick at most one; omitting both runs the
default Index):
- --move: Execute physical migration (Copy-Verify-Delete). Source files are
  moved: deleted after a verified copy lands at the destination. Confirmed
  exact duplicates are also removed from source once a verified copy of
  their content exists elsewhere at the destination.
- --copy: Non-destructive. Same verified Copy-Verify step as --move, but the
  source file is never deleted or modified afterward. Duplicate source files
  are also left untouched in this mode — nothing is ever removed from source.
- (neither of the above): Index — full scan, hashing, and destination-path
  resolution, exactly like --move/--copy would compute, but no physical
  action is taken. This is the safe default described in spec §4.1.

Cancellation: sending SIGTERM or SIGINT (e.g. `docker stop`, or Ctrl+C)
during a --move/--copy run lets the file currently being copy-verified
finish, then stops before starting the next one. During the Index/scan
phase it takes effect at the next batch boundary, and a scan cancelled that
way skips the move/copy phase entirely rather than entering it; everything
already written to the database is kept, so re-running simply continues. Every file that didn't get
a chance to run is written to the operations log with status='Cancelled' —
current, un-started work stays 'Pending' in the photos table (so a plain
re-run naturally picks it back up), while the operations log keeps a full
historical record of exactly what happened during that specific run,
including which items never got reached. Duplicate-source cleanup is
skipped entirely for a cancelled run, since it depends on every Pending
item's fate being fully known first.

Retries: there is no dedicated retry mechanism. If some files fail (or a
run is cancelled), just re-run the same command — files already moved are
gone from --source and won't be reprocessed; only what's still there (still
'Pending', or previously 'Failed' and re-flagged 'Pending' by the next
Index) gets touched again. This is fast because nothing already-successful
needs to be redone.

No result is ever silently lost across crashes either: a run interrupted by
something uncatchable (SIGKILL, OOM-kill, power loss) leaves its `runs` row
at status='Running' with no end time — the next invocation's startup
reconciliation detects this and marks it 'Crashed' with a real end
timestamp, rather than leaving a phantom "still running" entry forever.

System & Python Dependencies:
- System Binary (HARD REQUIREMENT — the engine refuses to start without
  both this binary and the PyExifTool Python package; see Metadata
  Extraction below for exactly what ExifTool is used for and why Pillow/
  rawpy/imagehash are still required alongside it, not replaced by it):
  - ExifTool
    Linux: sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
    macOS: brew install exiftool
    Windows: choco install exiftool
  - Python package: pip install pyexiftool

Metadata Extraction:
    ExifTool is used via a PERSISTENT process per worker (PyExifTool's
    `-stay_open` mode, one instance per ProcessPoolExecutor worker,
    started once via `_init_worker_process` and reused for every file that
    worker handles) rather than spawning a fresh `exiftool` subprocess per
    file. Measured directly: a repeat query against an already-running
    instance took ~2.6ms vs ~24ms+ paying process-spawn overhead — roughly
    a 10x difference that compounds significantly across a large library.

    For every file, the engine captures BOTH "date taken" (used to compute
    the destination folder) AND the full metadata set available (camera
    make/model, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and whatever else the source
    exposes) from the same underlying capture. Fallback order, falling
    through only if the previous step fails or finds nothing at all:

    1. ExifTool (persistent per-worker process, full tag set, not a
       curated subset) — the primary and now-guaranteed-available source.
       The only method that can read metadata from RAW-family files
       (.cr2, .nef, .arw, .raf, .raw, .dng), since neither PIL nor rawpy
       expose EXIF/metadata fields for those formats (rawpy only decodes
       pixel data, for pHash generation — it has no metadata-reading API
       at all).
    2. PIL (Image.getexif(), PLUS the "Exif" sub-IFD via get_ifd(0x8769))
       — a defensive per-FILE fallback, not a "ExifTool isn't installed"
       fallback anymore (that case can no longer happen — see above). Used
       only if ExifTool genuinely ran but returned nothing usable for a
       specific file. Works for standard formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC
       with pillow-heif); cannot open RAW-family formats at all.
    3. File modification time — used only if neither of the above
       produces a usable date. No richer metadata is available at this
       fallback level; the stored metadata is just {"date_taken": ...}.

    IMPORTANT — ExifTool being a hard requirement does NOT mean Pillow,
    rawpy, and imagehash became optional or got removed. They do a
    completely different job that ExifTool cannot do at all: ExifTool
    reads embedded metadata tags, it does not decode pixel data. pHash
    generation (compute_phash()) and thumbnail generation both require
    actually opening and decoding the image (PIL for standard/HEIC
    formats, rawpy for RAW-family formats) and feeding real pixel data to
    `imagehash.phash()` — there is no metadata-only substitute for this,
    and ExifTool's ability to extract an already-embedded camera preview
    image (where one exists) doesn't change that, since imagehash still
    needs that extracted preview decoded through PIL to hash it anyway.

    Creates a connection with WAL mode, NORMAL synchronous durability, and an
    extended busy timeout for concurrent safety.

    synchronous=NORMAL (rather than SQLite's default FULL) stops the engine
    fsyncing on every single commit, which measured ~4.4x faster on its own.
    The safety tradeoff is specifically bounded: under WAL, NORMAL still
    survives *process* death — SIGKILL, an OOM-kill, `docker stop` timing out
    — because committed data is already in the OS page cache and is replayed
    from the WAL on the next open. Only a kernel panic or power loss can lose
    recently committed transactions, and process death is by far the likelier
    failure here.

    That bound covers the CATALOG only; it does nothing for the photo files,
    which is why the file protocol carries its own ordering. A source is
    deleted only after its verified copy, the copy's directory entry, and
    every directory entry from --dest down to it have been fsynced (see
    _remove_verified_source and _mkdir_durable). With those in place, a power
    loss can leave a stale row, or a photo present at both ends — recoverable
    by re-indexing — but not a deleted original without a copy on storage
    that honours fsync.

    1. The copy is a DIFFERENT file. Two paths can name one file — one folder

       overlapping storage remains documented as unsupported, but it catches
       every alias the kernel can identify.
    2. The copy is DURABLE. Verification may have read it back from page
       cache. On a network source the server commits the delete as soon as
       the call returns, so a local power loss before the copy reached disk
       would leave no copy anywhere. The copy and its directory entry are
       fsynced first; the entries above it, up to --dest, were made durable

    Both distinctions were learned the hard way on a real library. Files differ
    enormously in cost — RAW was 13% of that library's files but 50% of its
    bytes, roughly 21 MB against 3 MB — so:

    - A cumulative average decays misleadingly. Indexing RAW first showed
      "34 files/sec" falling to "7 files/sec" over five minutes while the true
      rate was flat at 5.05 the entire time. That looks like something
      degrading. Nothing was.
    - A file count cannot distinguish "saturated link" from "broken". At 5.05
      files/sec the engine was moving ~101 MB/s, which is 1GbE at line rate —
      instantly recognisable as physics rather than a bug, but only if
      throughput is on screen. Without it an hour went into diagnosing a
      correctly-working scan.

    The ETA uses the recent rate rather than the average, so it responds when
    the workload changes character instead of averaging RAW and JPEG together.

    §4.1/§7) so at most one engine process ever runs against a given

    a physical operation on the same database is exactly as unsafe as two

    Returns the open file descriptor (caller must keep a reference to it

    Deliberately a flock, not a PID-file-existence check or a DB-row flag:
    the lock is tied to the holding process's open file descriptor, not to

    the kernel on ANY exit path — normal completion, an exception, or an
    uncatchable SIGKILL — with no manual cleanup possible or needed. This

    lock file sitting on disk looking exactly like a "stale" lock, but a
    fresh process was able to re-acquire it instantly, no waiting, no
    error. A container being force-stopped (`docker stop` timing out into
    SIGKILL) cannot leave this lock in a state requiring manual deletion.

    Caveat: flock reliability is weaker over NFS depending on lockd/statd
