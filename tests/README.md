# Tests

Everything here is for developing NegativeSpace; running the engine needs none of it.
CI runs all of it on every pull request and every push to `main`
(`.github/workflows/engine-tests.yml`).

Build the image first — the Python suites run inside it, because they need ExifTool,
Pillow, imagehash and rawpy:

```bash
docker build -f docker/app.Dockerfile -t negativespace .
```

## Engine smoke suite — `engine_smoke_test.py`

Drives the real engine as a subprocess against real image files rather than importing
it and stubbing things out; a few content-safety tests import it in-process to inject a
fault between two steps of one function. Mount your checkout over `/app` so it tests the
code you have rather than the code baked into the image:

```bash
docker run --rm -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  negativespace python3 tests/engine_smoke_test.py
```

A green run reports `N passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped`. The two skips are the RAW tests
(decoding and RAW thumbnails): LibRaw rejects fabricated files, so they run only when
`NS_TEST_RAW_DIR` points at a folder of genuine camera output, mounted into the
container:

```bash
docker run --rm -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) -e NS_TEST_RAW_DIR=/raw \
  -v /path/to/raw/files:/raw:ro -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  negativespace python3 tests/engine_smoke_test.py
```

Flags: `--filter NAME` runs tests whose name contains NAME (a filter matching nothing
is an error), `--keep` leaves the workspace on disk, `-v` shows engine output, and
`--engine PATH` runs the suite against another copy of `ns-engine.py` — the way to
prove a test catches the defect it guards against. The module docstring is the
authoritative reference.

The suite does **not** run under pytest: pytest mis-collects its `@test` registration
decorator and errors without running anything.

The `verified_recovery` tests interrupt real Moves around source deletion and check
fresh delivery, existing-copy reuse and duplicate cleanup. They verify destination
content before success, reject unreadable/non-file/changed candidates, check both
operations' destination participation, and inject a lineage-write failure to prove
the recovery transaction rolls back. Run this subset with `--filter verified_recovery`.

## Catalog contract suite — `database_test.py`

The catalog's contracts — schema initialization, settings revisions, concurrent
writers, transaction rollback, lineage invariants, backups — against synthetic
catalogs, with no image files:

```bash
docker run --rm -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  negativespace python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p database_test.py
```

## Web API suite — `webui_api_test.py`

The FastAPI layer (`webui/`) through FastAPI's test client, against a real catalog.
Jobs start the real `ns-engine.py` as a child process, as in production, so the
request-to-run handshake, the engine lock, cancellation and the derived outcome are
tested together:

```bash
docker run --rm -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) -v "$PWD":/app -w /app \
  negativespace python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p webui_api_test.py
```

To prove a test catches a defect in the API, copy the checkout, change the copy, and
mount the copy as `/app`: the API is imported in-process, so `--engine` cannot reach it.

## Web interface in a browser — `webui_browser_test.sh`

`tools/validate-similarity.py` creates deterministic original/resize/recompression/
brightness/crop image pairs, unrelated scenes and a flat-color collision. Run it
inside the app image, with a writable output mount:

```bash
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --entrypoint python3 \
  -v "$PWD":/app:ro -v /tmp:/output -w /app negativespace \
  tools/validate-similarity.py --output /output/ns-similarity-validation --benchmark-photos 10000
```

The output directory must be new. Open its `index.html` for a threshold slider,
side-by-side known pairs and an errors-only filter; `report.json` contains metrics.
The synthetic catalog benchmark measures initial/unchanged/incremental comparisons,
queue timings at three thresholds, logical database bytes and whole-process peak
RSS (KiB on Linux). Its clustered hashes and geometric fixtures are reproducible
diagnostics, not real-library quality or capacity claims. No real library is read.
The library may exceed 200,000 photos: use `--benchmark-photos 250000` for capacity
validation with headroom (the tool accepts up to 500,000). It measures both queue
and reference queries, seven times per threshold. Fixture creation and photo decode
are outside the comparison timings; whole-process peak RSS includes fixture setup.
Results describe the local temporary Docker catalog and its caches, not network
storage performance. Hash distribution and match density also affect scale.
Actual gallery/Inspector query timings and human judgments provide the next validation
step on a representative destination catalog after Index and Copy or Move. An
Index-only catalog has no reviewable destination photos. Side-by-side feedback
never modifies photos. Synthetic benchmarks create recorded destination copies
and assert that all requested photos are included in query measurements.

`DRIVER=similar_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh` checks the empty review after Index, then Copies
the isolated generated fixtures and checks cumulative Inspector counts, inline match
pagination, gallery selection preservation, side-by-side review and saved judgments,
reload/Back state, request failure retries, legacy bookmarks and narrow Inspector dialogs.

For manual validation after Copy, open a destination photo in the gallery and choose
**Similar photos** in the Inspector. Click a 75/80/85/90/95/100% count to browse
its matches in the thumbnail grid. Use
**Has similar photos** to narrow the gallery; the count buttons narrow only the
Inspector results. Reload and return from Logs to confirm the reference and threshold
remain. No new Index or Copy is needed for this UI change on a prepared schema-15 catalog.
It also checks shared preview zoom, persistent content-pair judgments, and diagnostics.
The database suite verifies the hash index against brute force and interrupted
comparison recovery; the API suite checks reference-only matches, hash changes,
availability, exact copies, thresholds and pagination.

`DRIVER=gallery_position_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh` checks
Logs photo positioning, offscreen Inspector navigation, retained filters, explicit
hidden-photo display, retry, ordinary gallery clicks, manual scrolling and History
action alignment. Its fixtures are generated photos in isolated containers.

`DRIVER=appearance_browser_drive.py SHOTS=/tmp/ns-shots sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
checks both neutral palettes in light/dark modes, text and input contrast, local
preference persistence, cross-tab updates, blocked storage, and narrow controls.
It also checks that Appearance is first in Settings and that dialog scroll cues
appear and disappear at the corresponding scroll boundaries.
Create the screenshot directory before mounting it. These screenshots use only
generated test photos. The normal browser driver also captures each main screen.

Both containers as `docker/compose.yml` arranges them (`app`, and `web` proxying `/api`
to it), driven by headless Chromium (Playwright) against generated photos. It covers first run, settings, Scan, the gallery,
the Inspector, selection, Copy, search and the phone-width layout, and fails on any
browser console error. It starts a server container and a Playwright container, so it
runs on the host:

```bash
docker build -f docker/app.Dockerfile -t negativespace . && docker build -f docker/web.Dockerfile -t negativespace-web .
sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh
```

`IMAGE=<tag>` and `WEB_IMAGE=<tag>` test other builds, and `SHOTS=<folder>` keeps
screenshots of the main screens for review by eye. The photos are generated, so the
screenshots show nothing from a real library. To prove it catches a frontend defect, change a copy
of the checkout, build that copy under another tag, and run with `IMAGE` set to it.

## Shell tests

These run on the host, not in the container, because the thing under test is a shell
script:

```bash
sh tests/sampler_test.sh                                   # the sampler never writes to the library
docker build -f docker/app.Dockerfile -t negativespace . && sh tests/entrypoint_test.sh   # the entrypoint's ownership handling
sh tests/shutdown_test.sh      # docker stop with a browser tab open: clean, and the app's shutdown runs
```

## Validating against real files — `make_sample_tree.sh`

Synthetic fixtures cannot stand in for a real library, but most checks do not need the
whole of one either. The sampler builds a small **hard-linked** sample: no extra disk
space, the originals' real bytes, mtime and EXIF, and one deliberate duplicate so
duplicate cleanup is exercised. Deleting from the sample never touches the library, so
it is safe to point `--move` at.

```bash
sh tests/make_sample_tree.sh [--no-raw | --all-types] <library> <sample> [every-Nth, default 25]
```

`--all-types` samples every file, not only photos — what the Index's file-type
accounting needs, since a photos-only sample excludes nothing. A sampled file shows a
link count of 2 (the duplicate 3); `du` reports the full size regardless, so link count
is the test that it is really linked.

## A library of scenarios — `make_scenarios.py`

For showing the app to someone, or checking it against every awkward case, without
sharing a real library. `build` hard-links every photo from a seed folder into
`OUT/library` and adds scenarios beside them: exact duplicates, the same photo without
its EXIF, resized and format-converted copies, dates the engine must file (none, with a
time-zone offset, conflicting, invalid, future, 1958, and one picture dated both 2024 and
1969), names that collide at the
destination or are awkward, every EXIF orientation, and edge files (empty, truncated,
not an image, a sidecar, a symlink, an unreadable file, a deep folder). `change` then
applies one round of every kind of change (edited in place, touched, renamed, moved,
deleted, replaced, new duplicates, a new date taken, and with `--dest` a destination
copy deleted, altered and a stranger added), which is what gives a photo's lineage
something to show. `OUT/manifest.json` lists every file, its scenario and what the app
should show for it. Without `--seed-dir` the photos are generated.

`--exif-donors` names a folder of camera files kept for their metadata, such as
[ExifTool's sample images](https://exiftool.org/sample_images.html): real tags from
hundreds of cameras on pictures shrunk to a few pixels. About three in four seed JPEGs
with no EXIF date get one donor's tags (camera, lens, exposure, dates, GPS, maker notes,
damaged ones included) on a fresh copy; the rest stay without, for No capture date. The
donor's size, previews and rotation are left behind, since they would contradict the
pixels. A donor folder inside the seed is left out of the originals, and six donors join
the library as themselves, tiny images for sorting out by resolution. Measured on a seed
of 4,700 downloaded photos with EXIF stripped and 7,119 donors: 3,420 given tags, dated
photos up from 3% to 70%, 296 camera makes, 53 s for the whole build.

The seed folder is never written to: every file the script alters is written anew and
renamed into place, which breaks its link first, and each run ends by proving it
(`seed: N file(s), untouched by this run`). A seed folder that is still filling, say
from a download, is reported, not mistaken for a write. `build` refuses a non-empty
folder it did not make, and rebuilds its own only with `--replace`.

Hard links need the seed and `OUT` on one filesystem **and one mount**, so mount their
common parent once. Create `OUT`'s parent yourself first: Docker makes a missing mount
path owned by root.

```bash
mkdir -p /photos/demos
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --entrypoint python3 \
  -v /photos:/photos -v "$PWD":/app -w /app negativespace \
  tests/make_scenarios.py build --seed-dir /photos/seed --out /photos/demos/demo \
    [--exif-donors /photos/seed/exiftool-samples] [--replace] [--seed N]
# Index and Copy with SOURCE_DIR=/photos/demos/demo/library, then:
docker run ... tests/make_scenarios.py change --out /photos/demos/demo [--dest <your DEST_DIR>]
# Index and Copy again: the lineage tree now has changes to show.
```

Its test, `make_scenarios_test.py`, runs in CI: a seed that must stay byte-identical, a
seed filling during a build, refusals, and the real engine's Index checked against the
manifest, including that an empty file and a text file named `.jpg` are logged as
**Not an image** and never filed.

## Spec and schema checks — `tools/`

Not tests of the engine, but CI gates on them and they exit non-zero on failure:

```bash
python3 tools/check-specs.py          # cross-references resolve, fences balance, tables are whole
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app negativespace python3 tools/check-schema-drift.py
                                      # engine-spec 6.5 matches what the engine creates
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app negativespace python3 tools/check-api-spec.py
                                      # every API route is in api-spec.md, and nothing else is
```

The browser harness also runs `ui_browser_checks.py` for shared control behavior: modal
focus, menus, field errors, help, theme contrast, failed-page retry and narrow layouts.
Selection checks preserve the toolbar height and navigation position while keeping
the selection actions' full-height click targets.
Single-photo Copy/Move confirms in a dialog without replacing the gallery or hiding
its sidebar; multiple-photo review remains covered by the full browser driver.
It also checks the Inspector's inner preview/details divider: pointer and keyboard
resizing, remembered proportions, and orientation changes in a wide desktop panel.
Outer-divider checks cover the gallery minimum, preserved filter width, oversized
saved Inspector widths, and recalculation after desktop window/filter resizing.
See `docs/ui-design.md` for the interaction contract and the manual accessibility checks
required before claiming WCAG conformance for the supported desktop experience.
Mobile support and real touch-device validation are optional; desktop zoom and reflow
remain in scope. Existing phone-emulation checks guard implemented behavior rather than
establishing a mobile release requirement.

Navigation (audit N8):
`DRIVER=navigation_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
checks same-page log and Library links, Back/Forward, open-photo restoration,
continuous scrolling and preservation of selection when leaving a focused view.

Preview refresh:
`DRIVER=preview_refresh_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
checks open Inspector details/history after transfers, recovery from a temporary
grid 404, bounded retries of persistent misses, unchanged healthy image elements,
selection/scroll retention and the non-link job-result help control.

Request identity (audit N7):
`SUBMISSION_FIXTURE=1 DRIVER=submission_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
drops responses after actual acceptance, including a fast finished job followed by
another tab's job and a slow Copy with an open confirmation. It also drops a request
before delivery, reloads the page, and retries using the same persisted ID. The
fixture delays Copy after acceptance; it otherwise runs the real engine. API tests
cover concurrent replay, conflict, lookup after API restart, safety-answer replay,
invalid IDs and a simulated late acceptance race. The normal suite exercises all
ordinary submission call sites using the same manager.

Safety questions (audit N6):
`NETWORK_FIXTURE=1 DRIVER=safety_questions_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
uses the real engine with only filesystem-type detection replaced, against the
harness's disposable photos. It checks explicit choices, cancellation, scope,
empty-source confirmation/reconnect and Copy versus Move confirmation. API cases
also test writable-source removal, selected/folder/whole-source targeting, stale
answers, changed roots, busy engine and unsupported input. No real network share
or maintainer data is needed; network durability itself is not tested.

For audit N4, `DRIVER=transfer_outcome_browser_drive.py sh tests/webui_browser_test.sh`
checks mixed and all-failed prerequisite scans for Copy and Move, including banner
counts and View failures links. It modifies only the harness's disposable photos.
The API suite also runs all four cases with a writable source to verify successful
Move alongside scan failures. Existing verdict cases cover cancellation, copied-only,
unchanged Index, repeated Copy and unrelated recovery.

### Preparing an existing similarity validation catalog

The 75% floor uses schema 15. Automatic startup upgrades remain disabled. To retain
schema-14 history and review judgments, stop the app and run the explicit
`tools/prepare-similarity-catalog.py --source <old-catalog> --output <new-catalog> --compare`
with the updated app dependencies. Output must be a new file. The tool uses SQLite
backup, widens and rebuilds only the derived comparison cache, and checks integrity
and foreign keys. Retain the original catalog before switching to the prepared copy;
do not switch a snapshot made before later user writes. It reads existing hashes,
not photo files. Other schema versions are refused.

### Shareable sample instance

`docker/compose.sample.yml` runs a separate app, web server and Docker network.
Provide an environment file with `SAMPLE_SOURCE`, `SAMPLE_DEST`, `SAMPLE_APPDATA`,
`SAMPLE_CACHE` and `SAMPLE_BACKUPS` pointing to distinct, existing directories.
Use a sample source (for example, the scenario generator's `library`), and new
writable directories. The source is always mounted read-only. Set `PUID`/`PGID`
to the directory owner and choose the built `SAMPLE_APP_IMAGE`/`SAMPLE_WEB_IMAGE`.

The default bind is localhost port 8082. For LAN sharing set `SAMPLE_BIND=0.0.0.0`
and open `http://<host-LAN-address>:8082`; `SAMPLE_PORT` can change the port.
Only the web port is published. The sample app has access only to its sample mounts.

```bash
docker compose --env-file <sample-env-file> -f docker/compose.sample.yml up -d
```

Create the catalog, run Index and Copy in this new instance. Then open a photo:
Photo information should appear first. Similar photos opens the counts and thumbnail
grid, initially at 90%. Resize the Inspector, switch tabs with the keyboard, and
move to the next photo: the tab/threshold should remain, with match paging reset.
Reload should restore the recorded tab and match page. The provided scenario set
contains intentional unreadable/invalid files; those are expected test outcomes.

Open a candidate using **Review side by side** to enter the expanded workspace:

1. Rotate and zoom each preview separately; then enable linked zoom/position.
   Rotation stays independent. Switch candidates and return: viewing transforms
   follow their photo until the workspace closes. No file orientation is saved.
2. Compare information, show all recorded tags, and filter to differences.
   Missing values and fallback dates should remain clearly labelled.
3. Record a pair judgment. Check Reviewed and Unreviewed, switch pages, then close
   and reopen: the saved judgment and progress survive. Browsing alone never saves
   a judgment or changes gallery checkboxes.
4. Resize the comparison/information divider and the browser window. Candidate
   browsing remains available; Back to gallery restores the Inspector context.
5. Choose **Use as reference** above a candidate. Its blue reference frame moves
   with the photo, its matches reload at the same threshold, and the previous
   reference appears beside it. Review status resets to All candidates on page
   one. Saved pair judgments and each photo's viewing rotation remain attached to
   the right photos. Back to gallery returns to the originally opened photo.

The generated-catalog browser check is `DRIVER=similar_browser_drive.py sh
tests/webui_browser_test.sh` (set `IMAGE`/`WEB_IMAGE` to the builds under test).
Metadata writes, deletion, deferred queues and workspace restoration across reload
are tracked in TODO.md; the current workspace implements comparison and judgments.
